                        As a parent, we all have certain moments in our lives that we don't want to remember or can say
                        if we had the power to
                        go back and change the actions of those moments. It could be the moment when you give your baby
                        a good scrub for the
                        first time and that first baby cries as a result, maybe you have to go to the emergency room
                        because you didn't take a
                        medicine while you were in a rush, or something like that. You have now overcome the
                        consequences of the unintentional
                        actions you did in those moments and they have faded a bit in your memory but you couldn't erase
                        a small guilt.
                        Although we know that we all make mistakes, many people think that some mistakes made at that
                        moment may have opened the
                        way for children to see me as a bad parent. Maybe if the child is angry or neglectful for some
                        reason, we think that the
                        neglect may have been born from that mistake. When these words come to our mind, perhaps my
                        responsibility as a parent
                        to myself is not done properly, but it is more important. That is why we need to know how we can
                        get rid of these guilt
                        feelings.

                        <div class="h4">Worry about the future</div>
                        <p>
                            All of us at one time or another are angry with our children and then maybe do something
                            that we
                            as a parent probably
                            shouldn't do. According to some child psychologists, we actually do crazy things because we
                            think that if we don't
                            correct a child's behavior now, he will continue to do the same behavior when he grows up,
                            which
                            is harmful for his
                            future. We wonder what if he never learns to do it right? What if he can't do anything in
                            the
                            future? These fears are
                            actually present in all of us, but if we exceed a certain level, we need to look at it
                            because
                            fear can often hinder us
                            from making the right decisions. A child's brain matures around the age of 25, so if a child
                            makes a mistake at the age
                            of 10, there is no need to assume that he will continue to make the same mistake for the
                            rest of
                            his life.
                        </p>

                        <div class="h4">Forgive yourself</div>
                        <p>none of us are above mistakes and it is true that a mistake about a child hurts the child the
                            most but there is no point
                            in sitting on a mistake. What a parent should do is put the mistake aside and think about
                            how to correct it. If there is
                            any negative emotion growing in the child then he will start to understand that my guardian
                            has the power to call wrong
                            and right and he should follow it.</p>

                        <div class="h4">No need to take anything personally</div>
                        <p>If one day your child throws a tantrum and tells you that he hates you, you as a parent will
                            naturally be upset. We may
                            have a down time from this upset and it will affect the baby. Instead of taking this type of
                            speech so personally, one
                            can think why he is saying it? He can be asked and he can be told what he says can improve
                            the situation.</p>
                        <div class="h4">You have to regulate your emotions by yourself.</div>
                        <p>
                            When you feel like you can't control yourself, take a little break and do what you feel like
                            doing. It is most
                            important. It's not like someone needs to be alone for 5 hours to keep themselves in shape
                            or something like that.
                            That's an exaggeration. It can be having a coffee alone, listening to a favorite music or
                            something else. So that people
                            around me don't take it negatively, they can be told why I need this little time alone.
                            There is a lot to learn from a previous parenting mistake and correcting it actually
                            guarantees one to be a better
                            parent in the future. There is no reason to feel so guilty about old mistakes. We cannot
                            change what has happened but we
                            can take care to prevent it from happening in the future. Just let it go.

                        </p>
