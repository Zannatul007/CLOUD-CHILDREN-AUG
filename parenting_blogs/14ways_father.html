                            <li>1. Staying by during breast-feeding:
                                <p>Breastfeeding the baby in the first few weeks is very difficult for the mother. At
                                    this time she may be busy
                                    breastfeeding most of the day. As a result, he cannot do many things by himself at
                                    this time. As a partner, you should
                                    keep him in the most comfortable position during this time. During this time, you
                                    can bring him water or juice along
                                    with some healthy snacks. Every now and then you can ask if he needs anything or if
                                    he needs to do some housework</p>
                            </li>
                            <li>Keeping the child in the lap:
                                <p>Apart from breastfeeding, there is nothing that the father of a newborn cannot do.
                                    Swaddling is a great opportunity for
                                    fathers to bond with their babies. This skin-to-skin connection, also known as
                                    'kangaroo care', is not only for mother
                                    and baby, but you, the father, feel free to spend as much time as you want. This
                                    time will also be a little rest for the
                                    new mother.</p>
                            </li>
                            <li>Let the mother sleep
                                <p>New mothers need more sleep. If the father has helped the mother in all the work
                                    after the birth of the child, then both
                                    the mother and the father need enough sleep. It is usually very difficult for a new
                                    mother to get enough sleep because
                                    she has to spend most of the sleepless nights with the baby. During this time father
                                    can give a mother enough sleep. You
                                    can spend some alone time with the baby by allowing the mother to sleep. Reassure
                                    the mother that you will attend to the
                                    baby properly.</p>
                            </li>

                            <li>Change the baby's diaper:
                                <p>
                                    You can do some of the baby chores yourself during the time you stay at home.
                                    Newborn diapers
                                    need to be changed several
                                    times a day. Father should do this whenever he gets a chance. Doing it once or twice
                                    will make
                                    the job much easier and
                                    the baby's mother will be very happy to have you as her partner.</p>
                            </li>

                            <li>Bathe the child:
                                <p>Bathing a newborn may seem like a daunting task, but it's actually a bonding
                                    activity. For the first few days you can
                                    follow the baby's mother and master how to do the task. If mom can do it then surely
                                    you can too. Bathing a baby is a
                                    very fun moment</p>
                            </li>

                            <li>Get up at night to feed the baby:
                                <p>Whether the baby is breastfed or formula fed, you as the father can sometimes take
                                    over the responsibility of feeding
                                    the baby. After the baby breastfeeds, ask the mother to pump enough milk for the
                                    night. And eat the formula yourself
                                    according to the quantity. Remember that if you take over some nights, it will be a
                                    huge opportunity for the new mom to
                                    rest</p>
                            </li>

                            <li>Cook for the baby's mother
                                <p>Since a large part of the Mother's Day is spent on childcare, it is difficult for her
                                    to find time for other activities.
                                    If your partner used to do the cooking before the arrival of the child in the
                                    family, then it may not be fair to expect
                                    the same to happen after the arrival of the child. Instead, why not surprise the new
                                    mom by doing the cooking for her
                                    during this difficult time.</p>
                            </li>
                        </ul>
