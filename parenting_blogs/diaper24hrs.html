                        <p>Diapers are an essential product for babies these days. Parents want to keep babies in
                            diapers
                            for most of the day for their child's and their own convenience. But have you thought about
                            how
                            healthy it is to wear diapers for a long time?
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            First let's talk about the benefits of diapers. Keeping the baby in diapers reduces the
                            hassle
                            of cleaning the diaper. Where there is no possibility of tapering. By doing this, parents
                            are
                            very sure. Some babies are used to being in diapers 24 hours a day. This is especially
                            common
                            for children from foreign countries. This reduces the suffering of those who manage children
                            at
                            home. So many benefits of using diapers. But have you ever wondered what the baby's problems
                            can
                            be as a result of using diapers all the time?<br>
                            Many may say that if children in foreign countries are wearing diapers all the time, what is
                            the
                            problem with wearing our children? Actually, we have no problem. But the weather of our
                            country
                            is quite different from the weather of foreign countries. Due to excessive heat and humidity
                            in
                            our country, wearing diapers all the time can cause various harm to the baby. Most babies
                            with
                            sensitive skin develop rashes due to regular diapers. Being wet all the time and not getting
                            any
                            air at all causes the problem of skin rash. Due to which the child suffers a lot, and
                            cries.<br><br>
                            In addition, various fragrances and chemicals are used to create fragrances in diapers or to
                            enhance their effectiveness. Many children are allergic to these chemicals. As a result,
                            rash
                            may cause skin spots.
                            The normal blood circulation of the baby's skin is disrupted due to wearing diapers that are
                            too
                            tight. As a result, your baby's normal growth is damaged without your knowledge and your
                            baby
                            suffers but cannot speak. If the baby wears diapers with feces and urine for a long time,
                            there
                            is a possibility of getting a urine infection. So the diaper should be changed as soon as
                            the
                            baby poops.<br><br>
                            Also, it is not healthy to wear the same diaper for more than 3 hours. Change your baby's
                            diaper
                            every 3 hours.
                            Always try to use good quality diapers for baby. Clean the area with a cotton pad dipped in
                            lukewarm water or rinse with water every time you change a diaper. Then refrain from
                            diapering
                            him for a while.
                            If you are in the habit of wearing diapers overnight, at least check and change them during
                            the
                            night or better not. If you develop a rash for any reason, use a good quality rash cream.
                            First of all, take care of the health of the child. If the inconvenience outweighs the
                            benefits
                            of using a diaper, then it is better not to wear it.<br><br>
